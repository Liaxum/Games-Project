# Games Project

Welcome everyone to my games project repo.
At this place, you will discover all the games that I have been skilled to produce, or that is in the process of being made.

If you wanted to use a game for personal purposes please kindly ask me first to indicate the modalities to follow for the installation or development tips.

If you want to support a certain project propose to me examples of what you do (Games for developers, 3D or 2D models for artists, music for musicians,...).

I hope that all will go well and that everyone will find their happiness in this repo.

The following represents a small description of the game projects.

## Project 1: RTS 

Oh... But what is it? Wouldn't this be the first game project? Exact!

For this project, I imagined it during and for a video game design course using the 3C method(camera, controls, and character)

Let's start:

- Camera: the camera will be a top view. The player will be capable to move the camera horizontally and vertically. He can on top move it in depth to be able to zoom in on the action.

- Controls: The controls will be done mainly with the mouse, but also with the keyboard to gain efficiency. The player will have to deploy buildings for resources. To collect resources, produce units, or construct defenses. The player will have to develop a strategy to be able to wreck the base of his enemies, but also think of a way to defend himself.

- Character: The character represents a person who commands an army. It will be editable as well as the country of origin. The character is part of a nation at war, and who participates in many battles to finally win this war.

I would like to include something that doesn't necessarily appear in the 3C. For this game, I would desire wars between nations to be interactive. For example when a person engages in a battle against another person (in ranked or in another mode) according to the person and the nation to which it belongs the war evolves.

And for this game I need an name idea.
